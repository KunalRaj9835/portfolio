  description: "Hey, I'm Kunal Raj — a frontend and mobile developer passionate about turning messy, complicated UIs into smooth, pixel-perfect experiences. I thrive on clean design, neat code, and that satisfying click or swipe when everything just works seamlessly. Whether it’s a complex web app or a mobile interface, I enjoy bridging the gap between functionality and visual delight, making every interaction intuitive and enjoyable.",
  description2: "I fix frontends like puzzles — every detail matters. I believe great UX is invisible yet unforgettable, and I take pride in creating interfaces that feel effortless to use. From web pages to mobile apps, I focus on crafting experiences that are not just visually appealing but also highly functional. Late-night refactors? Guilty — because I know the difference a single tweak can make in creating something truly remarkable.",
